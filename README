TitanUp is a library of utility functions for Titanium Mobile that provides
a number of custom views like an ImageGallery, a cross-platform SimplePicker,
a SelectBar, as well as utilities for building dynamic multi-density user
interfaces, managing themes, and managing windows within tabgroups.

This distribution includes a demo app that uses all the features of the
library, so it should be fairly apparent how to use it.
